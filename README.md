## Configuration

1. **Movie Folders**: Add paths to your movie directories in the web interface
2. **Genres**: Configure your preferred genre categories

   - Get a TMDB API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

## How It Works

1. When you select a movie, MovieOrg:
   - Cleans up the filename (removes quality indicators, etc.)
   - Uses GPT-4 to analyze the movie title and suggest a genre
   - If GPT-4 can't determine the genre, uses TMDB as a fallback
   - Moves the file to the appropriate genre folder
   - Cleans up empty source directories

2. The application maintains a clean directory structure by:
   - Creating genre folders as needed
   - Moving movie files to their genre folders
   - Removing empty source directories (preserving non-movie files)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- TMDB API key (optional, but recommended)
- Modern web browser
